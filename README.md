# Shuttle Charging Simulator

This project simulates the charging process of electric shuttles using Java.
Each shuttle has a battery capacity and current charge level. Shuttles are
prioritized for charging based on their battery percentage using a custom
Comparator implementation.

## Features
- Object-oriented design with clear class responsibilities
- Custom Comparator for shuttle prioritization
- Simulation of charging behavior
- Clean and readable Java code structure

## Classes
- Shuttle: Represents an electric shuttle with battery information
- Charger: Handles the charging process
- ShuttleComparator: Defines charging priority logic
- Simulator: Runs the simulation

## Technologies
- Java
- Java Collections Framework
